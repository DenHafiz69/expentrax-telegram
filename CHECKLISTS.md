# Expentrax - A Telegram Expense Tracking Bot

This project is a complete rewrite of my previous Telegram bot, Expentrax. The goal is to build it from scratch without the use of any AI tools, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and code. This project is for CS50's final project.
